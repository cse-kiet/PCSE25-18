2. Awadhesh Kumar Maurya
3. Ayush Prakash

## Steps for Execution:
1. You must have Python3.8 installed in your machine.
2. Create a Python Virtual Environment & Activate Virtual Environment Link
3. Install all the dependencies using below command pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Go to the Flask Deployed App folder.
5. Download the trained model file plant_disease_model_1.pt
6. Add the downloaded file in Flask Deployed App folder.
7. Run the Flask app using below command python3 app.py
8. You can also use downloaded file in Model Section and play with it using Jupyter Notebook.

⭐Testing Images
If you do not have leaf images then you can use test images located in test_images folder
Each image has its corresponding disease name, so you can verify whether the model is working perfectly or not
